    <description><![CDATA[People often use SSH to avoid entering their username and password while pushing commits to github or gitlab. I like to use this excellent unix password utility called Pass .
Why use pass instead of SSH  Anyone who can gain access to your computer (physical, or through some form of hacking) can push changes to your github. the gpg-agent locks itself after some time has elapsed You can kill the gpg-agent when you are not not using the machine Github recommends using personal access tokens  A disadvantage though is, you will have to enter your password store password from time to time.]]></description>
