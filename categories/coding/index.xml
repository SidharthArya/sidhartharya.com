    <description><![CDATA[Imagine you are writing a very convoluted program with all sorts of threading magic. You want to continuously test various sections of your program before moving on with the next task. Would you rather write all the functions in the file at the same time and start debugging the code for errors, or would you rather fire up an ipython shell with your program loaded up and available to you?]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Qutebrowser Qutebrowser is the best web browser for developers, hands down. Nothing can compare to the flexibility it offers. Now, ofcourse other web browser must have ways of enabling and disabling various fancy features, but it&rsquo;s much harder to achieve.
I have a number of scripts that i use on a daily basis in qutebrowser which i maintain here (SidharthArya/.qutebrowser ) on a daily basis.
The Problem One of the issues i have sometimes is to reach localhost on various ports quickly.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[People often use SSH to avoid entering their username and password while pushing commits to github or gitlab. I like to use this excellent unix password utility called Pass .
Why use pass instead of SSH  Anyone who can gain access to your computer (physical, or through some form of hacking) can push changes to your github. the gpg-agent locks itself after some time has elapsed You can kill the gpg-agent when you are not not using the machine Github recommends using personal access tokens  A disadvantage though is, you will have to enter your password store password from time to time.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I don&rsquo;t have a good introduction today. So let&rsquo;s just get to the post.
Org mode provides something called org protocol in order to let other applications be able to pass their data into the emacs server instance. We exploit this feature of emacs to write a little script which can capture stuff in org mode and store links from the browser.
Org Protocol &ldquo;org-protocol intercepts calls from emacsclient to trigger custom actions without external dependencies.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The best Rss or Atom feed reader is elfeed . There is no competition at all in comparison to it, thanks to the excellent programming done by skeeto (Christopher Wellons) .

    <description><![CDATA[Recently, i decided to go into full nix mode. So i boot my laptop. Created a 500MB Partition for nixos&rsquo;s root. Added a new dataset to my already existing zfs pool called pool/nix. And i made the switch. For those who don&rsquo;t know what nix is, beware the hacker inside you may be drawn to it.
To be honest though, I never loved nix. The first time i tried it was in a 11 year old laptop, and the experience was really bad.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Almost anything you can think of to do with your linux system, can possibly be done in nixos. And it would also be reproducible at that. So i set out to get a custom theme for my boot up screen which is usually provided by plymouth in linux. Since we need to add a new theme to the system we should do that by creating a new package for the same.]]></description>
