# A Sinful Smile


I walked a space when i couldn't walk time,

I walked alone when i couldn't control my mind.

I stopped to pick up the fallen leaves,

Then I walked again with a sinful smile.

I covered my ears when i felt my tears,

I covered my eyes when i couldn't help my deeds,

I covered my mouth when it could be helped...

Then I covered my face with a sinful smile.

I stopped to see how far I have come,

I stopped to see how my grave was done,

I stopped to see a better world without me,

So I stepped into my grave with a sinful smile.

Let me be reborn with a kinder self,

Let me take away all the pain in the world,

Take rgmy soul straight to hell, for I have been a devil,

But let me take away all the pain, the world is dealt.
