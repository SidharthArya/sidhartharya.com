[{"categories":["personal"],"content":"“It’s harder to accept the truth when the lies were exactly what you wanted to hear” The biggest lesson I have learned is this one quote. I have been a child my entire life, while being an adult, I am still a child. I still high five the leaves every time I pass by them as if they understand my gesture, I still look into the sky and hope to reach a distant star. It seems time is not what defines your age. 25 years while being a long time, it doesn’t quantify how well attuned we are with the world. I have been aloof for a long time. Not cold, just aloof. People mistook my aloofness for maturity. When maturity itself is relative. Age is not relative to maturity at all it seems. Cold as it may sound, the world has been a circus for me. In this circus, I have been a naive child, struggling to understand what it means to be in this circus. What is life ? What is death? What is God? Why am I here? What purpose do I have? As it turns out there is no purpose for anything at all. We choose to give purpose to whatever we may find most relevant. These thoughts have always been in my mind. I have been a logical thinker, thinking about everyone’s well being. Why should everyone be well? So that I can see them and get a sense of what wellness means? Is that good enough a reason? Honestly I don’t know. I don’t know what I do and why I do it. My mind has been more puzzling to me than anyone else’s. Give a meaning and move on is what everything has been doing but I am here stuck with very primitive thoughts that people move away from. Should you move on ? Yes, ofcourse. I am unable to though. I am okay with not knowing things, instead of giving meaning to these things, but I will always pursue trying to know them more and more, layer by layer. In this circus though I had no attachments. So it became even more puzzling why would I do good for people? Hey, it’s okay to not be attached and do good. But I never knew it would be painful to be attached. At a very young age, I gave up on being attached. I was an adult in a young body. That’s what all the monks do, right? Let’s get away from the world and live without any attachments. No attachment, no pain, no suffering. While I meditate, I never accepted this concept very well. It felt like running away. I remember consulting a therapist for not getting attached with people and not having any emotions. I had no trouble empathizing with them but I could never get attached to anyone. It felt very inhuman. A blank canvas with nothing painted on. So given the circumstances, I would either become a very good person or a very bad one. Thankfully, I was able to get attached. Without the experience that people may have had at a very young age with attachments, I had been a kid in that respect. So I messed up. Given how introverted I had been, and how much I don’t like to speak about someone else, I didn’t even care about talking to someone about it to help me out. I am thankful for the things that have happened to me because I did deserve them. I was unable to see beyond my own attachments, I was unable to see beyond what I had been seeing. In chess if something is pinned by the other person, you are more than likely to concentrate on that rather than seeing a better move right before your eyes. I don’t know how long it would take for me to forgive myself, perhaps never. Since I could not get attached, I never thought of getting into a relationship. While I got into one, being totally detached from the other person. And messing that up in a really special way. I know a bit better now. While people have been making these mistakes over and over as children, I always questioned them as to why? They saw me as a mature person, but I was never attached leading to my puzzled question. You may want everything good for the person you are attached with, but the inability to understand them can lead to them suffering with you. It becomes ironical, to say the least. At such times, letting go is all you can and should d","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/a-circus-of-attachments/:0:0","tags":["personal"],"title":"A Circus of attachments","uri":"/a-circus-of-attachments/"},{"categories":null,"content":"I walked a space when i couldn’t walk time, I walked alone when i couldn’t control my mind.

Org mode is really a markup language which has all sorts of amazing features. These amazing features can also be extended and hacked on very easily. Hugo is a static site generator. It would basically take your content and based on some rules as defined by itself and a theme, it would generate a neat website. ox-hugo implements an exporter, which turns your org mode files into a markdown file, which is then used by hugo to generate the website. Finally, org-roam extends the standard org mode to have a zettelkasten method like feel to it. Where you basically concentrate on writing your notes and you can make the necessary connections to other notes as and when you need to. You can also tag your files with various keywords. It’s an amazing package, i urge you to visit its documentation since i may not have explained it very well. But, it’s the most useful package for me.

There is no competition at all in comparison to it, thanks to the excellent programming done by skeeto (Christopher Wellons) . I urge my readers to go through his blog at null program . elfeed-org is a package that makes it simpler to write the list of elfeed feeds you need with tags and categories, etc in an org file. WIth that said, let’s dive in. I have tried all sorts of rss feed readers, commercial and non commercial, but none compare to the flexibility and robustness of elfeed. Tagging. Filtering. Extensibility. What does it not have? It can do all sorts of things. You can tag an entry based on what keywords it contains. For example, if a news item contains the keyword “Bitcoin” then it’s probably a good idea to tag it as crypto. But this article is not about all the glorious things elfeed can do. It is about one of my quick dirty hacks to make my life slightly easier. A very particular nuisance for me was to add a feed in the elfeed-org and manually update that feed, and run hooks. Either i did that, or i directly ran elfeed-update command which updates all my feeds. That is a really bad idea. Since the more requests you make to a server, the more the chance that you will get blocked for misusing it. Many websites don’t block you though, but some do, either permanently or partially. The function i wrote is given below: (require 'dash) (defun my-elfeed-org-update () \"AUtomatically Update the feeds from feeds.org when updated\" (setq my-elfeed-org-last (or (and (boundp 'elfeed-feeds) elfeed-feeds) nil)) (elfeed) (setq my-elfeed-org-current elfeed-feeds) (let ((elfeed-feeds (-difference my-elfeed-org-current my-elfeed-org-last))) ;; You don't need the line below if you don't want to see a message about what feeds are being updated (message \"%s\" elfeed-feeds) (mapc #'elfeed-update-feed (elfeed--shuffle (elfeed-feed-list)))) (setq elfeed-feeds my-elfeed-org-current)) I add the given lines to the top of my feeds.org file. # Local Variables: # after-save-hook: my-elfeed-org-update # END: You will get an unsafe variable prompt every time you save the file thereafter. But, now your feeds will be immediately fetched when you update the feeds.org file. Well, actually i don’t really use the above file setting. I use (setq-global after-save-hook 'my-elfeed-org-update) in my config since i use different instance for elfeed using my modular-config package.

Goal which network parts can be scaled, removed, or replaced by more efficient modules, at which gains in complexity and which loss in quality. Specifically, we investigate the influence of RNN size, type, and the use of disconnected parallel RNNs. For CRNs with a symmetric convolutional encoder/decoder structure, we investigate the convolution layers, spectral vs. spectro-temporal convolutions, and skip connections. As a result, we propose an efficient CRN structure with around 4-5 times less computational operations with similar quality than previously proposed CRNs.

Input Features are log power spectra Output is a real-valued, time varying suppression gain per time frequency bin To compute a single frame, the network requires only the features of the current frame, or when using causal convolution, also several past frames. So latency depends only on the STFT window size. STFT consistency is enforced by propagating FD output through reconstruction and another STFT to compute a FD loss. Both Predicted and target signals are normalized by the active target utterance level, to enure balanced optimization for signal level dependent losses. MSE is used, blending the magnitude only with a phase aware term, which is found to be superior to other losses for reverberant speech enhancement. Loss function is given by \\[L = (1-\\lambda)\\Sigma_k,n||S|^c - |\\hat S|^c|^2 + \\lambda \\Sigma_k,n||S|^c e^j\\psi s - |\\hat S|^c e^j \\psi s|^2\\] where c = 0.3 is a compression factor, λ = 0.3 is a weighting between complex and magnitude based loss, and omitted the dependency of the target speech spectral bins S(k,n) on the frequency and time indices k, n for brevity. The networks are trained in batches of 10 sequences of 10 s length using the AdamW optimizer, learning rate of \\[8 * 10^-5\\] and weight decay of 0.1. The best model is picked based on the validation metric using a heuristic optimization criterion using perceptual evaluation of speech quality, scale invariant signal to noise ration and cepstral distance \\[ Q = PESQ + 0.2 * siSRD - CD\\] ","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/braindump/braun21_towar_effic_model_real_time/:1:3","tags":["braindump"],"title":"Towards efficient models for real-time deep noise suppression","uri":"/braindump/braun21_towar_effic_model_real_time/"},{"categories":["braindump"],"content":"NETWORK ARCHITECTURES NSnet2 Consists only of fully connected and gated recurrent unit layers in the form FC-GRU-GRU-FC-FC-FC.

CRUSE CRN U-Net structure Convolutional Recurrent U-net for Speech Enhancement (CRUSE) L symmetric convolutional and deconvolutional encoder and decoder layers with kernels of size (2,3) in time an frequency dimensions. Convolution kernels move with a stride of (1,2) i.e. downsample the features along the frequency axis efficiently while the number of channels C_l for layer 1,…,L increase per encoder layer, and decrease mirrored in the decoder. In this work the input and output channels C_in = C_out = 1 but they can be extended to e.g. take complex values or multiple features as multiple channels. Convolutional layers are followed by leaky ReLU activations while the last layer uses sigmoid. Between encoder and decoder sits a recurrent layer, which is fed with all features flattened along channels. Using 1 GRU layer over 2 LSTM layers at this stage leads to little performance loss, but huge computational savings GRU saves 25% complexity compared to an LSTM layer. Further Modifications Parallel RNN grouping Performance of both CRUSE and NSNet2 directly scales with bottleneck size i.e. the width R of the central RNN layers. However, the complexity of RNN layers scales with R^2 making wide RNNs computational unattractive. There for RNNs are grouped into P disconnected parallel RNNs, still yielding the same forward information flow. Possible parallel execution of disconnected RNNs.

Specifically, we investigate the influence of RNN size, type, and the use of disconnected parallel RNNs. For CRNs with a symmetric convolutional encoder/decoder structure, we investigate the convolution layers, spectral vs. spectro-temporal convolutions, and skip connections. As a result, we propose an efficient CRN structure with around 4-5 times less computational operations with similar quality than previously proposed CRNs.

Input Features are log power spectra Output is a real-valued, time varying suppression gain per time frequency bin To compute a single frame, the network requires only the features of the current frame, or when using causal convolution, also several past frames. So latency depends only on the STFT window size. STFT consistency is enforced by propagating FD output through reconstruction and another STFT to compute a FD loss. Both Predicted and target signals are normalized by the active target utterance level, to enure balanced optimization for signal level dependent losses. MSE is used, blending the magnitude only with a phase aware term, which is found to be superior to other losses for reverberant speech enhancement. Loss function is given by \\[L = (1-\\lambda)\\Sigma_{k,n}||S|^c - |\\hat S|^c|^2 + \\lambda \\Sigma_{k,n}||S|^c e^{j\\psi s} - |\\hat S|^c e^{j \\psi s}|^2\\] where c = 0.3 is a compression factor, λ = 0.3 is a weighting between complex and magnitude based loss, and omitted the dependency of the target speech spectral bins S(k,n) on the frequency and time indices k, n for brevity. The networks are trained in batches of 10 sequences of 10 s length using the AdamW optimizer, learning rate of \\[8 * 10^{-5}\\] and weight decay of 0.1. The best model is picked based on the validation metric using a heuristic optimization criterion using perceptual evaluation of speech quality, scale invariant signal to noise ration and cepstral distance \\[ Q = PESQ + 0.2 * siSRD - CD\\] ","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/braindump/20210726230715-towards_efficient_models_for_real_time_deep_noise_suppression/:1:3","tags":null,"title":"Towards efficient models for real-time deep noise suppression","uri":"/braindump/20210726230715-towards_efficient_models_for_real_time_deep_noise_suppression/"},{"categories":null,"content":"NETWORK ARCHITECTURES NSnet2 Consists only of fully connected and gated recurrent unit layers in the form FC-GRU-GRU-FC-FC-FC. All FC layers are followed by ReLU activation Except the last layer has sigmoid activations to predict constrained suppression The standard layer dimensions are 400 for GRUs and 600 for FC layers i/e/ 400-400-400-600-600-K Also investigated different configurations The input and output dimensions are the number of frequency bins. CRUSE CRN U-Net structure Convolutional Recurrent U-net for Speech Enhancement (CRUSE) L symmetric convolutional and deconvolutional encoder and decoder layers with kernels of size (2,3) in time an frequency dimensions. Convolution kernels move with a stride of (1,2) i.e. downsample the features along the frequency axis efficiently while the number of channels Cl for layer {1,…,L} increase per encoder layer, and decrease mirrored in the decoder. In this work the input and output channels Cin = Cout = 1 but they can be extended to e.g. take complex values or multiple features as multiple channels. Convolutional layers are followed by leaky ReLU activations while the last layer uses sigmoid. Between encoder and decoder sits a recurrent layer, which is fed with all features flattened along channels. Using 1 GRU layer over 2 LSTM layers at this stage leads to little performance loss, but huge computational savings GRU saves 25% complexity compared to an LSTM layer. Further Modifications Parallel RNN grouping Performance of both CRUSE and NSNet2 directly scales with bottleneck size i.e. the width R of the central RNN layers. However, the complexity of RNN layers scales with R^2 making wide RNNs computational unattractive. There for RNNs are grouped into P disconnected parallel RNNs, still yielding the same forward information flow. Possible parallel execution of disconnected RNNs.
