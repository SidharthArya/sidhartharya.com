# Microsoft


## Marketing {#marketing}

Marketing from microsoft is really bold, but sometimes unethical and
not true. For example:

-   Windows 11 is the only windows to have tiling support. Disregarding
    hundreds of tiling window managers on Linux
-   Microsoft CNTK was the first machine learning framework to support
    ONNX, when the development of ONNX was under complete control of microsoft

Personally, I do mind the bad marketing, it makes me wonder what else
is a company lying about. If not for this domain of microsoft, I would
be using windows along with linux.
