## Graph Mining {#graph-mining}

Graph Mining is a set of tools and techniques used to (a) analyze the properties of real-world graphs, (b) predict how the structure and properties of a given graph might affect some application, and (c) develop models that can generate realistic graphs that match the patterns found in real-world graphs of interest.
